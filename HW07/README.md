### Solution Description

In this homework assignment, you will be developing the Singly-Linked LinkedList data structure, which will implement the provided List interface. In doing so, you will write a variety of methods from each.

You will also be creating your own generic Node class that your LinkedList will use. The provided interface and the classes you create will be written using generics such that they could work for any class parameter - you will be facing many of the challenges that the developers who wrote the java.util.LinkedList class had to confront, as that class uses generics, too!
